## Extra Features

### 1. TypeScript

This project is set up with TypeScript which brings several advantages:

- **Type Safety:** Type safety at compile time helps to catch errors early, leading to safer, more predictable code.
- **Improved Developer Productivity:** Thanks to autocompletion, smart suggestions, and detailed error messages provided by TypeScript, your development process is more efficient and productive.
- **Better Code Quality:** TypeScript's static typing can lead to cleaner, more precise code and supports object-oriented programming patterns.

### 2. Fade Animation Loader

This project incorporates a fade animation loader. 

### 3. Custom Button Component

We have a Custom Button Component in this project. This standard button component can be reused throughout the application, providing a consistent look and feel. The benefits are:

- **Consistency Across the App:** Reusable components provide a consistent user interface, leading to a more coherent user experience.
- **Efficiency:** Instead of rewriting the same code, developers can reuse components, which is a more efficient use of time and resources.
- **Easy to Maintain and Update:** Changes need to be made only at one place, reducing the chance of errors and inconsistencies.

### 4. Conventional Commit

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. The benefits of using this approach are:

- **Improved Readability:** The commit history is more readable, and it's easier to understand the history at a glance.
